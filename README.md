Made a single page application that allows users to see a list of artists, the list of albums connected to that artists and a list of songs connected to those albums.  Each java entity was mapped and connected to one another through manytoone relationships or manytomany relantionships.  We had a seperate admin page using react that would allow the admin to add, update, delete or edit each of our entities.  We used Javascript to connect our backend API and stylized everything using CSS.  We used agile methodology as we built out our project doing tasks in 3 day sprints.  We used TDD to drive out the the different compenents in our project.
